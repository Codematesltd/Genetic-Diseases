# Genetic Disease Prediction - Model README

## âœ… Project Description
This project uses a machine learning model to predict one of five genetic diseases based on biomedical test features.  
The model is trained on a synthetic yet realistic dataset and achieves ~95% accuracy.

### Predicted Diseases:
0 â†’ Thalassemia  
1 â†’ Hemophilia  
2 â†’ Breast Cancer  
3 â†’ Sickle Cell Anemia  
4 â†’ Cystic Fibrosis
